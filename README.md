# Module-18-Challenge_CitiBike
I downloaded Jan 2023 to July 2023 Citibike data and then used the jupyter notebook to combine the Jan -July data as well as creating a winter combined csv and spring combined csv. I am not able to use the git add and git commit as in the terminal I am requested to enter password and authentication is failed as such I have uploaded the file directly to githhub.
